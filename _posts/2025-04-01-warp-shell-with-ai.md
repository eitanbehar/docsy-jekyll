* Do you like using shells: sh, cmd, ps
* Do you feel forgetting how to do things, 
like `what's the command to remove all directories and sub and force and and recursive and all?`
* Do you like AI or talking to AI, or just want to say you are AI aware?

Then, my very serious recomendation:

Go **Warp** a very neat, cool, easy-to-use, and powerful command line (shell) tool, with AI built-in
