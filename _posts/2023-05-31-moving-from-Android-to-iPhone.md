After several years on Android, I moved recently to iPhone.
Here are my takes on the process

Android history: Galaxy 2, Galaxy 4, Galaxy 6, Pocofone, Pixel 4 XL
Moving to: iPhone 14 Max

# What I like
* Smoothness, both switching apps and within apps
* Font control over particular apps
* Apple Pay
* Car Play
* Silent physical button

# What I miss
* Trusted device/location to unlock device
* Google News integrated on swipe right 
* Scan to PDF to Google Drive
* Control over audio control

# What's very similar and not worth moving for
* Camera
* Battery life
* Audio quality
