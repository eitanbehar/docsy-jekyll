GitHub allows you to host pages directly from your repo (all SAP users have GitHub accounts)
Here are the steps I did:
For GitHub:
Create a repository for your project (you can name it anything).
Add your HTML file (e.g., index.html) to the repository.
Go to the repository's Settings > Pages.
In the Source section, select the branch where your HTML file is located, and choose the root folder.
GitHub will provide you with a link to access your hosted HTML page.
